# Classification of Fetal Arrythmia using Electrocardiogram Signal Processing and Machine Learning

This project evaluates the efficacy of Non-Invasive Fetal Electrocardiogram (NI-fECG) in detecting fetal cardiac arrhythmia via ML tools as an alternative to conventional invasive, expensive, risky, and manual diagnostic methods
